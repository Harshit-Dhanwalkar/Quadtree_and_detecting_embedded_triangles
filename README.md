# Animated Quadtree and Embedded Triangles

This project visualizes an animated quadtree and embedded triangles using Python and matplotlib.

## Description

The script generates a number of random points and triangles. Each point is animated and moves around the plot. The plot also includes a quadtree, which is a tree data structure used to partition a two-dimensional space. The triangles are colored based on whether they are inside the quadtree.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the `Animated_quadtree_and_embedded_triangles.py` file:

```bash
python Animated_quadtree_and_embedded_triangles.py
```

## Dependencies
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

 ● [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
